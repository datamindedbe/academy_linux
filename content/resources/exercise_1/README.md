# Dataminded Academy - Introduction to Git
## Exercise 1 - First commit

In this exercise you will have to use the most fundamental `git` commands. The tasks are the following:

1. Open a terminal and position yourself in the root of this folder (`exercise_1`).
2. Try to run `git status`. What do you see? Why?
3. Initialize a Git repository in this folder by running the appropriate command.
4. Re-run `git status`. Is the output different? 
5. Start version-controlling the `my_code.py` file.
6. Commit a change to the `my_code.py` file.
7. Check the Git logs. What do they see there?
